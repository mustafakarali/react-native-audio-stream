- **Stream Types Supported**:
  - HLS (.m3u8) - Uses HlsMediaSource
  - DASH (.mpd) - Uses DashMediaSource
  - SmoothStreaming (.ism, .ism/Manifest) - Uses SsMediaSource
  - Progressive (MP3, AAC, WAV, OGG, FLAC) - Uses ProgressiveMediaSource
  - Local files (file:// or absolute paths)
  - Base64 audio data via playFromData()
  - Streaming chunks via appendToBuffer()
  
#### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- Audio focus management (Android 8.0+ API)

- Custom headers support
- Background playback
- Buffering control and statistics
- Bandwidth monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling

- Progress and metadata extraction

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- POST requests with body not fully supported (use playFromData() for TTS)
- Equalizer returns mock data (would need AudioEffect API integration)
- RTSP not implemented (but can be added easily)

#### üìù No Code Changes:
This version documents the current Android implementation status after thorough review.
All features listed above are already implemented and working.

## [1.10.8] - 2024-12-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL API FIX**: Fixed default export to return singleton instance instead of class
- This fixes the `AudioStream.initialize is not a function` error
- The API structure is now preserved as intended: `AudioStream.getInstance()` or using the default export directly
- All example code and documentation should work correctly now

## [1.10.7] - 2024-12-29

### Fixed
- Fixed Android build errors in Media3 migration:
  - Added missing `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` import from `androidx.media3.exoplayer.source`
  - Removed unused `Metadata` import that was causing compilation errors
  - Removed duplicate import statements
- This completes the Media3 migration with all necessary imports properly configured

## [1.10.6] - 2024-12-29

### Fixed
- Fixed Android build error: corrected `DefaultBandwidthMeter` import path from `androidx.media3.datasource` to `androidx.media3.exoplayer.upstream`
- This fixes compatibility with Media3 package structure where `DefaultBandwidthMeter` is located in the `upstream` package

## [1.10.5] - 2024-12-29

### Fixed
- **Critical Android Build Fix**: Removed phantom MemoryDataSource import that wasn't in source but appeared in npm package
- Fixed Base64 import: removed java.util.Base64 (requires API 26+) in favor of android.util.Base64
- Removed conflicting androidx.media3.common.AudioAttributes import
- Cleaned up all remaining ExoPlayer2 references
- Ensured clean build before npm publish

### Technical Details
- Fixed inconsistency between local source and npm published package
- Proper Base64 support for API 23+ devices
- AudioAttributes now properly uses android.media version for audio focus
- Complete Media3 migration is fully functional

## [1.10.4] - 2024-12-29

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Migrated from ExoPlayer2 to AndroidX Media3
  - All ExoPlayer2 dependencies replaced with AndroidX Media3 equivalents
  - Improved performance and better future support
  - No API changes - all methods remain the same
  - Smaller APK size with modular dependencies

### Technical Details
- Updated Android dependencies:
  - `com.google.android.exoplayer2:*:2.19.1` ‚Üí `androidx.media3:*:1.2.0`
  - All imports updated to use `androidx.media3` packages
  - Using Media3's modular architecture for better optimization

### Notes
- This is a major internal change but maintains full backward compatibility
- Media3 is the new home of ExoPlayer and receives all new features
- Better integration with AndroidX ecosystem

- Memory-efficient chunk processing without loading entire audio

### Use Cases
- Real-time TTS streaming from ElevenLabs, Deepgram, etc.

### Example
```typescript
// Start empty stream
await AudioStream.startStream('', { autoPlay: true });

// Stream chunks as they arrive
const response = await fetch(ttsUrl);
const reader = response.body?.getReader();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  
  const base64Chunk = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(value)));
  await AudioStream.appendToBuffer(base64Chunk);
}
```

## [1.8.0] - 2025-01-20

### Added
- üöÄ **POST Request Support**: Full HTTP POST support for `startStream()` method
- Support for POST body (both string and object formats)

- Automatic Content-Type detection for JSON bodies

### Use Cases
- Direct TTS streaming from services requiring POST requests
- API endpoints that need request bodies
- Authentication tokens in POST body
- Complex query parameters via POST

### Example
```typescript
await AudioStream.startStream('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/voice-id/stream', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'xi-api-key': 'your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: {
    text: 'Hello world',
    model_id: 'eleven_multilingual_v2',
    voice_settings: {
      stability: 0.5,
      similarity_boost: 0.5,
    },
  },
